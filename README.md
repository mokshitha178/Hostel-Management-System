# Hostel-Management-System
The Hostel Management System is a robust application designed to streamline hostel operations, utilizing Apache server and MySQL 5.62. It features two distinct modules: Admin and User. The Admin Module allows administrators to securely log in, manage their profiles, and update passwords. Administrators can create, edit, and delete courses and rooms, allocate seating, and set fees. They also handle student registrations, manage complaints, review feedback, and retrieve forgotten passwords. The User Module enables users to register, log in, and recover forgotten passwords. Users can manage their profiles, book hostel rooms, view room details, register and track complaints, provide feedback, and change their passwords. This system provides a comprehensive solution for efficient hostel management.
